# Unsupervised_ML_model
Predicts symptom based on mold type and vice versa

Mold exposure is a serious problem, at least 40% of the US population is impacted but not aware of it.

1.	Unlabeled Data :Unsupervised learning
2.	Large & Complex data: Clustering Algorithm well suited for such datasets 
3.	Goal: Identify patterns & Correlations between [Mold Type, Symptoms, Diagnoses]
